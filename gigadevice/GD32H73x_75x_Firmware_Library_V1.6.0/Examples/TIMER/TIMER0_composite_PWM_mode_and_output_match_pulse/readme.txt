  This demo is based on the GD32H759I-EVAL-V2.0 board, it shows how to configure TIMER0_CH0/
CH1 in composite PWM mode and TIMER0_CH2 output match pulse.

  TIMER0 configuration:
  - CH0, CH1 and CH2 output composite PWM waveform.
  - CH2 enable the output match pulse function.

  TIMER0 frequency = CK_TIMER/ (299+1) = 1MHz. The PWM frequency is 1MHz/ (99+1) = 10KHz.
  - CH0 configuration in composite PWM mode, the high level duty cycle 80% (100%-(60-40)/100*100%).
  - CH1 configuration in composite PWM mode, the high level duty cycle 20% ((60-40)/100*100%).
  - CH2 will output 2 pulses when the matching event occurs.
