  This demo is based on the GD32H759I-EVAL-V2.0 board, it shows how to configure the
TIMER0 peripheral to generate four different TIMER0 signals.

  TIMER0 frequency is fixed to 300MHz, TIMER0 prescaler is equal to 15000, so TIMER0 
counter frequency is 20KHz. The PWM frequency is 2Hz.

  TIMER0_MCH0 is independent of TIMER0_CH0, and the TIMER0_MCH1 is independent of 
TIMER0_CH1. The four duty cycles are computed as the following description:
  - the channel 0 duty cycle is set to 20 %.
  - the multi mode channel 0 duty cycle is set to 60 %.
  - the channel 1 duty cycle is set to 40 %.
  - the multi mode channel 1 duty cycle is set to 80 %.

  Connect the TIMER0 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
  - TIMER0_CH0  pin(PA8).
  - TIMER0_MCH0 pin(PA7).
  - TIMER0_CH1  pin(PA9).
  - TIMER0_MCH1 pin(PB0).
