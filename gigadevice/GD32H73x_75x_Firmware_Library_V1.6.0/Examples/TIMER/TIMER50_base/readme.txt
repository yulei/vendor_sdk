  This demo is based on the GD32H759I-EVAL-V2.0 board, it shows how to configure the 
TIMER peripheral update interrupt with the corresponding interrupt request to generate 
a time base.

  The TIMER50 frequency is set to 300MHz, the prescaler is 1500, so TIMER50 counter
frequency is 200KHz. TIMER50 CARL is 200000, so the period is 1s(200000/200000 = 1s).

  Enable the update interrupt, so the TIMER50 generates an interrupt each 1s, in the 
handler routine, LED2 is toggled each 1s.
