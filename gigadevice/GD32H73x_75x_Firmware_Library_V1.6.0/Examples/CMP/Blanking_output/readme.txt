  This demo is based on the GD32H759I-EVAL-V2.0 board, it shows how to configure the
comparator blank function.

  CMP0 is configured as following:
  - Inverting input is internally connected to VREFINT = 1.2V.
  - Non inverting input is connected to PB0.
  - Output is internally connected to port output(PC5).
  - TIMER1_CH2 is selected as blanking source.
  - PB0 is connected to TIMER1_CH3(PA3).
  TIMER1 is configured as following:
  - TIMER clock frequency is set to systemcoreclock.
  - Prescaler is set to 599 make the counter clock is 1MHz.
  - Configure TIMER1_CH2 as the blank source.
  - Counter autoreload value is 9999 and CH2/CH3 output compare value is 499/4999.
  - TIMER1_CH2/TIMER1_CH3 outputs PWM with 5/50% dutycycle.

  Connect PA3 and PB0 as CMP non inverting input. use oscilloscope to observe CMP
input pin(PB0) and output pin(PC5) at the same time, the output signal is low level at the
beginning of the dutycycle.
