   This demo is based on the GD32H759I-EVAL-V2.0 board, it shows how to make an analog 
watchdog by using comparator peripherals in window mode.

  CMP is configured as following:
  - Non Inverting input is connected to PB0.
  - The upper threshold(CMP0 inverting input) is set to VREFINT = 1.2V.
  - The lower threshold(CMP1 inverting input) is set to VREFINT / 2 = 0.6V.
  - The input voltage is configured to be connected to VR1.

  After system start-up, enable comparator, the status of LEDs depend on the input voltage.
  If the input voltage is above the higher threshold, LED1 and LED2 are all turned on.
  If the input voltage is within the thresholds, LED1 turned on, LED2 turned off.
  If the input voltage is under the lower threshold, LED1 and LED2 are all turned off.
