  This example is based on the GD32H759I-EVAL-V2.0 board, it provides a basic 
communication between USART1 (Synchronous mode) and SPI0. First, USART1
transmits a series of data to SPI0, then SPI0 transmits a series of data 
to USART1. Compare the transmitted data and the received data. If the 
data transmitted from USART1 and received by SPI0 are the same, LED1 will be 
on, otherwise off. If the data transmitted from SPI0 and received by USART1 
are the same, LED2 will be on, otherwise off.

  connect SPI0 SCK  pin(PB3) TO USART1_CK  pin(PA4)
  connect SPI0 MISO pin(PB4) TO USART1_RX  pin(PA3)
  connect SPI0 MOSI pin(PB5) TO USART1_TX  pin(PA2)
