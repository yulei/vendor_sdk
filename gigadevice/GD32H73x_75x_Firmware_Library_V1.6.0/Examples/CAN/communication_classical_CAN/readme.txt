  This demo is based on the GD32H759I-EVAL-V2.0 board, it shows how to configure the 
CAN2 peripheral to send CAN frames, and CAN1 peripheral to receive CAN frames in normal mode.

  When WAKEUP button is pressed, CAN2 sends a message to CAN1, when CAN1 receives correctly 
this message,the receive data will be printed and LED1 toggles one time. 

  User must connect L pin to L pin, and H pin to H pin of JP14 and JP12 on the board for sending and 
receiving frames.

  Jump JP53, JP65 and JP67 to CAN, JP50 to LED, JP68 to USART.
  GD32H759I-EVAL-V2.0 CAN transceiver needs 5V power supply.
